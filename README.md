Project: Solution to the Babysitter Kata

The solution to this kata is implemented in Python3.

No outside libraries are required to be downloaded for this solution to work. However, the solution does utilize the built-in unittest library.

This solution conforms to all rules provided in the kata itself.
The solution assumes that bedtime must be before midnight, as the rules state that there is a different charge rate between bedtime and midnight.
The solution also assumes that bedtime can also be the end time for the babysitter, as the parents could arrive at bedtime and there is no rule that disallows this.
